# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin (`om`) — a personal skills collection. Current skills:

- `/obsidian-refine-daily-note [date]` — Improve daily notes: polish writing, add wikilinks, extract long sections, suggest new entities
- `/obsidian-session-summary` — Capture session summary into Obsidian vault and link from daily note
- `/obsidian-weekly-rollup [date]` — Generate weekly summary from daily notes
- `/obsidian-transcribe-meeting <url-or-path>` — Transcribe a meeting recording and create a structured meeting note
- `/intervals-time-entry [date]` — Fill Intervals time entries from daily notes (`Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- `/intervals-to-freshbooks [week-start]` — Sync a week of Intervals entries to FreshBooks
- `/github-pr-review` — Review a PR and post findings as inline comments to GitHub

There is no build system, test suite, or linter. The project is pure JavaScript (browser scripts executed via chrome-devtools MCP) and Bash (API utilities).

```

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` that defines the complete workflow — these are the authoritative references for how each skill operates.

### Cache System

Cache lives in the **user's project** (not this plugin repo), making the plugin read-only and distributable:

```
<user-project>/.claude/intervals-cache/
├── project-mappings.md        # Discovered project→worktype mappings
├── github-mappings.md         # Learned repo→project associations
├── outlook-mappings.md        # Learned calendar→project associations
└── fetch-github-activity.sh   # Auto-synced script (version-checked)
```

This cache-aside pattern means browser inspection only happens once per project — subsequent runs skip directly to filling entries (3-4 MCP calls total vs 50+ without caching).

### Browser Script Conventions

All scripts in `scripts/` are executed via `mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script`. They must:

- Use **arrow function format**: `() => { ... }` or `async () => { ... }` (not IIFEs)
- Use **native property descriptors** for form updates (React/framework compatibility):
  ```js
  const nativeSetter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(
    window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value'
  ).set;
  nativeSetter.call(input, value);
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
  ```
- Return structured JSON objects with results and error details
- Configure behavior through constants at the top of the script (e.g., `PROJECTS_TO_DISCOVER`, `DAY_INDEX`, `ENTRIES`)

### FreshBooks API Integration

`freshbooks-api.sh` is a full REST API wrapper with:
- OAuth2 token auto-refresh (5-minute expiry buffer)
- 1Password credential reference support (`op read` integration)
- Cached business/account IDs at `~/.config/freshbooks/cache.json`
- Commands: `projects`, `clients`, `project-id`, `client-id`, `create-time-entry`, `list-time-entries`

### GitHub Activity Correlation

`fetch-github-activity.sh` uses `gh` CLI to pull PRs authored, reviewed, and events for a given date. The intervals-time-entry skill uses this to enrich time entry descriptions with PR context and learn repo→project mappings.

### Outlook Calendar Correlation

The skill reads the Outlook calendar visually via browser screenshot (chrome-devtools MCP). It navigates Outlook Web to the target date's day view (`https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/day/YYYY/M/D`) and takes a screenshot. Claude then visually extracts meeting subjects, times, durations, and declined status. No API tokens or Azure AD setup required — just be logged into Outlook Web in the same Chrome instance. The skill uses calendar data to:

- **Detect missing time entries** — meetings in the calendar with no corresponding notes entry
- **Validate durations** — flag discrepancies between notes and actual calendar event times
- **Enhance descriptions** — use meeting subjects and visible attendee names to replace vague notes like "meeting" with specific details
- **Time gap analysis** — combine calendar events with GitHub commit timestamps to reconstruct the full workday and identify unaccounted blocks
- **Learn mappings** — auto-populate `outlook-mappings.md` with recurring meeting→project associations (inferred from subjects, attendees via `people-context.md`, or user confirmation)

### Time Entry Persistence

After filling entries in Intervals, the skill writes them back in two forms:

- **Daily note table** — An `### Intervals` markdown table inserted into the daily note with project, hours, and description columns. Provides a permanent Obsidian record of what was submitted.
- **SQLite database** — Entries are inserted into `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/.claude/time-entries.db` for cross-day/week/month querying. Uses `INSERT OR REPLACE` for idempotent re-runs.

## Plugin Distribution

Plugin metadata lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Install with:
```bash
claude plugin install om-skills@olivoil
```

## Testing Local Changes

To test plugin changes before pushing, use `--plugin-dir` from the **consumer project** (where daily notes and cache live):

```bash
# 1. Disable the installed version so it doesn't conflict
claude plugin disable om

# 2. Run with local plugin source (path to this repo's checkout)
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/skills/

# 3. Test the skill as usual
#    > /intervals-time-entry 2026-02-04

# 4. Re-enable the installed version when done
claude plugin enable om
```

**Key points:**
- `--plugin-dir` is additive — if the installed plugin is still enabled, it may take precedence
- Always disable the installed plugin first to avoid version conflicts
- Changes are picked up immediately — no reinstall needed, just restart the Claude session
- Run from the consumer project directory, not from this repo

## Dependencies

- Obsidian desktop app with CLI enabled (Settings → General → CLI) for vault-native operations
- `qmd` CLI (installed via `bun install -g @tobilu/qmd`) for semantic vault search
- Chrome/Chromium with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` and chrome-devtools MCP server
- `gh` CLI (authenticated) for GitHub activity fetching
- `curl` and `jq` for FreshBooks API calls
- (Optional) `op` CLI for 1Password credential references
- (Optional) Outlook Web logged in for calendar correlation (same Chrome instance)
